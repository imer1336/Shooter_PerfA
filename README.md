# Shooter_PerfA

This is a basic 2d shooter game with enemies spawning in

using dots system to move and shoot.

to spawn in enemies(scriptable objects) 

added some variables for enemy movespeed,damage,hp.


for memory optimization I have been using prefap for enemies so they share the same data pool instead of having different ones for each enemy.
